Update 3

# March Note App

A simple and secure note-taking application built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Passport.js for authentication.

## Features

- User authentication (register, login, logout)
- Create, read, update, and delete notes
- Secure password storage with bcrypt
- Protected routes for authenticated users
- Responsive design with Bootstrap

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v12.0.0 or higher)
- MongoDB (local instance or Atlas)
- Git

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AndrewLILP/March-Note-App.git
cd March-Note-App
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/march-note-app
SESSION_SECRET=your_secret_key_here
```

Replace `your_secret_key_here` with a strong random string for session security.

## Database Setup

Ensure MongoDB is running on your system. The application will automatically:

- Connect to the MongoDB instance specified in your `.env` file
- Create the necessary collections (users, notes)

## Running the Application

Start the application in development mode:

```bash
npm start
```

The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

└── app.js                    # Main application file
```

## Usage

1. Register a new account at `/auth/register`
2. Log in with your credentials at `/auth/login`
3. View your dashboard at `/dashboard`
4. Manage your notes at `/notes`
5. Add new notes at `/notes/add`
6. Edit notes at `/notes/edit/:id`
7. Log out at `/auth/logout`

## Authentication Flow

1. **Registration**: Users provide name, email, and password. Passwords are hashed before storage.
2. **Login**: Users authenticate with email and password. Passport.js handles authentication.
3. **Session**: Express session maintains user login state.
4. **Protected Routes**: Middleware ensures only authenticated users can access certain pages.
5. **Logout**: Terminates the user's session.

## Security Features

- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- Protected routes with authentication middleware
- Session management with express-session
- Input validation for registrations and form submissions

## Dependencies

Key packages used in this project:

- express: Web framework
- mongoose: MongoDB ODM
- passport and passport-local: Authentication
- bcryptjs: Password hashing
- express-session: Session management
- connect-flash: Flash messages
- ejs: Templating engine
- method-override: HTTP method override for PUT/DELETE requests
